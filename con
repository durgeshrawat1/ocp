| Overview | One-to-one connection between two VPCs. | Centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs. | Secure access to services via private IP. |
| Connectivity | Direct connection between peered VPCs. | Centralized connectivity between multiple VPCs. | One-to-one private connectivity to specific services. |
| Ideal for | Small to medium scale, limited VPCs. | Large-scale, multiple VPCs across accounts. | Exposing services from one VPC to others securely. |
| Scalability | Not scalable for many VPCs (requires multiple connections). | Highly scalable, can handle connections from many VPCs. | Scalable for accessing specific services but less flexible for full VPC communication. |
| Transitive Connectivity | Not supported. Each VPC must be peered with others directly. | Supported. All VPCs connected to TGW can communicate with each other. | Not supported. Limited to service access, not full VPC communication. |
| Route Management | Requires manual configuration of route tables for each peering. | Centralized route table for all VPCs. Simplifies routing management. | Route management is specific to service endpoints, not full VPC traffic. |
| Security | Depends on VPC peering security groups and ACLs. | Centralized control with security groups, NACLs, and route tables. | Fine-grained access control via security groups for service endpoints. |
| Cost | Lower cost for a small number of VPCs. | Can incur additional costs for Transit Gateway usage. | Typically more expensive for high-volume traffic. |
| Internet Dependency | No internet access required. | No internet access required. | No internet access required. |
| Complexity of Setup | Simple to set up for a few VPCs. | More complex, requires Transit Gateway setup and routing configurations. | Requires setting up service endpoints and VPC endpoints. |
| Best Use Case | Small-scale, direct communication between a few VPCs. | Large-scale architecture requiring communication between multiple VPCs. | Making IBM Turbonomics available to multiple accounts via private connections. |
| Example Use Case | Connecting two or three VPCs in different accounts. | Connecting 20 VPCs across multiple accounts securely. | Exposing IBM Turbonomics to multiple accounts via private connections. |
