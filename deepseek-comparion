End-to-End RAG AI Chatbot Solution Implementation

First, I need to outline the steps. Let me break down the requirements:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Handle different file formats. So, I'll need to read these files. For Erwin, I'm not sure about the format. Maybe it's ERwin data models? The user might need a specific parser for that, but since it's not a common format, perhaps they have a way to export it to something else. For now, I'll mention that Erwin might require a custom parser.

2. **Storage**: Store original docs in S3. That's straightforward using boto3 to upload files to S3.

3. **Processing**:

- **Text Extraction**: For PDFs, use PyPDF2 or similar. For XLSX, pandas. CSV is easy. Erwin might need custom handling.

- **Chunking**: Split text into manageable chunks. Maybe use LangChain's text splitter.

- **Embeddings**: Use AWS Bedrock's Titan Embeddings model. Generate embeddings for each chunk.

4. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in DocumentDB (MongoDB compatible). So, each document chunk will have its vector stored there. Need to set up indexes for vector search. DocumentDB supports storage of vectors, but querying might require using aggregation pipelines with vector similarity search. Wait, DocumentDB might not have built-in vector search like Pinecone, so maybe use a library like FAISS alongside? Hmm, but the user specified DocumentDB. So perhaps store the vectors as arrays and use cosine similarity or similar. But efficient nearest neighbor search might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to Amazon DocumentDB Elastic Clarity, which supports vector search? Wait, maybe I should check. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, DocumentDB doesn't natively support vector embeddings. Oh, but the user might be using a workaround. So perhaps store the embeddings as arrays and perform a similarity search using aggregation pipelines with $dotProduct or other math operators. That might be inefficient for large datasets, but for a private environment, maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use Amazon OpenSearch, which has k-NN support. But the question states DocumentDB, so proceed with that.

5. **Query Handling**:

- User query is embedded using Bedrock.

- Search DocumentDB for similar vectors.

- Retrieve top N chunks.

- Pass to Claude Sonnet via Bedrock to generate a response.

6. **AWS Services Setup**:

- Ensure S3 bucket is created.

- DocumentDB cluster set up with proper security groups, VPC.

- Bedrock access configured, IAM roles for Lambda/EC2/etc. to access S3, DocumentDB, Bedrock.

- Claude Sonnet model accessible via Bedrock.

7. **Security**: Since it's a private AWS environment, VPC endpoints for S3, DocumentDB, and Bedrock might be needed. Also, IAM roles with least privilege.

8. **Code Structure**:

- Lambda functions or EC2/ECS for processing?

- Maybe a script to process documents, another for querying.

- Use pymongo for DocumentDB interactions.

- Boto3 for S3 and Bedrock.

Potential issues to address:

- Handling large files: chunking properly.

- Error handling in document processing.

- Efficient vector search in DocumentDB.

- Authentication and network setup for private environment.

Now, structuring the code:

First, the document processing pipeline. A script that reads files from a local directory (after downloading from S3?), processes each file based on type, splits into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores in DocumentDB.

But wait, maybe the documents are uploaded to S3, and then a Lambda is triggered to process them. That would be more event-driven. But the user might want a batch process. Since the user provided example code with a script, perhaps they prefer a script that processes all documents from S3.

But for simplicity, maybe the code assumes documents are uploaded to S3, then the script processes them.

So, steps:

1. Upload documents to S3.

2. Run processing script that:

a. Downloads files from S3.

b. Extracts text.

c. Chunks text.

d. Generates embeddings.

e. Stores in DocumentDB.

3. Query script that takes a question, embeds it, searches DocumentDB, generates response.

Now, code structure:

- config.py: AWS settings, DocumentDB connection string, S3 bucket, etc.

- document_processor.py: Handles different file types, text extraction, chunking.

- embeddings.py: Uses Bedrock to generate embeddings.

- vector_db.py: Manages DocumentDB interactions (store vectors, search).

- chatbot.py: Handles the query, RAG process.

Testing each component:

For Erwin files, since it's a proprietary format, the user might need to convert them to another format first, or use an Erwin API. Since that's unclear, maybe the code skips Erwin or uses a placeholder.

Wait, the user mentioned the business provided documents in those formats, so the code must handle them. So, for Erwin, perhaps the user has .erwin files which are XML-based? Maybe parse them with XML libraries. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. So in the code, perhaps include a placeholder function for Erwin parsing, advising the user to implement based on their specific Erwin model format.

Similarly, for XLSX: use pandas. CSV: straightforward. PDF: PyPDF2 or textract.

But textract is more powerful, especially for scanned PDFs. However, it's an AWS service. Since the user is in a private AWS environment, maybe they have access to Textract. But to avoid external dependencies, maybe use PyPDF2 for text extraction, with a note that for complex PDFs, Textract is better.

So, code outline:

DocumentProcessor class with methods for each file type.

EmbeddingGenerator using Bedrock.

VectorDB class for DocumentDB.

Chatbot class that uses the above.

Now, implementing each part.

For the vector search in DocumentDB, when querying, compute the embedding of the query, then perform a query to find documents with the highest cosine similarity. Since DocumentDB doesn't support vector indexes, this might involve calculating the dot product or cosine similarity in the query.

Cosine similarity formula: (A Â· B) / (||A|| * ||B||). To compute this in MongoDB, you can store the vector and its magnitude. For each stored vector, precompute its magnitude. Then, when querying, compute the dot product between the query vector and stored vectors, and divide by (query_magnitude * stored_magnitude). But since the query's magnitude is constant for a given query, you can sort by dot product divided by stored magnitude to approximate the cosine similarity.

So, in the vector DB storage, for each chunk, store:

- text: the chunk text

- embedding: the vector array

- embedding_norm: the magnitude of the vector

Then, for a query vector q, with norm q_norm, compute the dot product between q and embedding, then divide by (q_norm * embedding_norm). The higher the value, the more similar.

In MongoDB aggregation pipeline:

Compute dot product as $dotProduct between q and embedding. Then divide by (embedding_norm * q_norm). Sort by this value descending.

But in DocumentDB, does $dotProduct work? Let me check. As of DocumentDB 4.0, support for aggregation operators includes $map, $reduce, but $dotProduct was introduced in MongoDB 5.0. DocumentDB 4.0 is compatible with MongoDB 4.0, so $dotProduct may not be available. Therefore, perhaps need to compute the dot product manually using $reduce.

Alternatively, precompute the normalized embeddings (unit vectors) and compute the dot product, which is the cosine similarity. If the embeddings are normalized, then the dot product is the cosine similarity. So when storing, normalize the embedding vector and store it. Then, the query vector is also normalized, and the dot product is the cosine similarity. This way, you can compute the dot product in the query.

So, steps:

1. When generating embeddings, normalize them (divide by the norm) before storing. Also store the original norm if needed.

2. For a query, normalize the query embedding.

3. Compute the dot product between the query embedding and the stored normalized embeddings. The higher the dot product, the higher the cosine similarity.

This way, in DocumentDB, the aggregation can compute the dot product using $reduce.

But how to implement this in DocumentDB.

Alternatively, use a library to compute the similarity in the application layer. But that would require fetching all vectors, which is inefficient. Not feasible for large datasets.

Hmm, this is a problem. If DocumentDB doesn't support efficient vector operations, the RAG solution might not scale. Maybe the user should consider a different vector database like OpenSearch. But according to the question, they want DocumentDB. So proceed with workaround.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's DocumentDB is actually MongoDB Atlas, which has vector search capabilities. But the question says DocumentDB. So perhaps proceed with the application-side approach, but that's not efficient.

Alternatively, during the processing phase, precompute the embeddings as normalized vectors, and in the query phase, compute the dot product in the aggregation pipeline using $reduce.

Here's how that might look:

For each document in DocumentDB:

{

"doc_id": "abc",

"text": "chunk text",

"embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ...], // normalized

"embedding_norm": 1.0 // since normalized

}

For a query embedding q (normalized), compute the dot product with "embedding" field.

In MongoDB aggregation:

[

{

"$addFields": {

"dot_product": {

"$reduce": {

"input": { "$zip": { "inputs": [ "$embedding", q ] } },

"initialValue": 0,

"in": { "$add": [ "$$value", { "$multiply": [ { "$arrayElemAt": [ "$$this", 0 ] }, { "$arrayElemAt": [ "$$this", 1 ] } ] } ] }

}

}

}

},

{ "$sort": { "dot_product": -1 } },

{ "$limit": 5 }

]

This should compute the dot product between the stored embedding and the query vector q. Then sort and limit.

This approach works, but it's computationally expensive as it has to scan all documents. For a small dataset, it's manageable. But for large data, it's not efficient. But given the user's constraints, this is the way to go.

Now, in the code, when querying, generate the aggregation pipeline dynamically with the query embedding.

Another consideration: embedding dimensions. Bedrock's Titan embedding model outputs 1536-dimensional vectors. So the embedding arrays will be of length 1536.

Putting it all together.

Now, writing the code.

First, the document processor:

Handling different file types.

For PDF: PyPDF2.

For XLSX: pandas read_excel, combine all cells into text.

For CSV: pandas read_csv, combine into text.

For Erwin: Placeholder, as format is unknown. Maybe .erwin files are XML, so parse with xml.etree.ElementTree.

But the user needs to implement that part based on their Erwin model.

Text splitting: Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain.

Embedding generation: Call Bedrock's Titan Embed Text model.

Vector DB: Connect to DocumentDB using pymongo, store the chunks with embeddings.

Chatbot: Take query, embed, search, generate response with Claude.

Now, the code.

First, config.py:

AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1'

S3_BUCKET = 'my-documents-bucket'

DOCUMENTDB_URI = 'mongodb://username:password@docdb-cluster-endpoint:27017/?ssl=true&ssl_ca_certs=rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem&replicaSet=rs0'

DATABASE_NAME = 'rag_db'

COLLECTION_NAME = 'documents'

Bedrock client setup.

Then document_processor.py:

import io

import pandas as pd

from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# other imports

class DocumentProcessor:

def __init__(self):

self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(

chunk_size=1000,

chunk_overlap=200

)

def process_file(self, file_path, file_type):

if file_type == 'pdf':

text = self.extract_pdf(file_path)

elif file_type == 'xlsx':

text = self.extract_excel(file_path)

elif file_type == 'csv':

text = self.extract_csv(file_path)

elif file_type == 'erwin':

text = self.extract_erwin(file_path)

else:

raise ValueError("Unsupported file type")

chunks = self.text_splitter.split_text(text)

return chunks

def extract_pdf(self, file_path):

with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:

reader = PdfReader(f)

text = ''

for page in reader.pages:

text += page.extract_text()

return text

def extract_excel(self, file_path):

df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

text = df.to_string()

return text

def extract_csv(self, file_path):

df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

text = df.to_string()

return text

def extract_erwin(self, file_path):

# Placeholder for Erwin data model extraction

# This requires custom implementation based on Erwin file format

raise NotImplementedError("Erwin file processing not implemented")

Then, embeddings.py:

import boto3

import json

from config import AWS_REGION

class EmbeddingGenerator:

def __init__(self):

self.bedrock = boto3.client(service_name='bedrock-runtime', region_name=AWS_REGION)

def generate_embedding(self, text):

body = json.dumps({

"inputText": text

})

response = self.bedrock.invoke_model(

body=body,

modelId='amazon.titan-embed-text-v1',

accept='application/json',

contentType='application/json'

)

response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())

embedding = response_body.get('embedding')

return embedding

Then vector_db.py:

from pymongo import MongoClient

from config import DOCUMENTDB_URI, DATABASE_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME

import numpy as np

class VectorDB:

def __init__(self):

self.client = MongoClient(DOCUMENTDB_URI)

self.db = self.client[DATABASE_NAME]

self.collection = self.db[COLLECTION_NAME]

def store_chunk(self, doc_id, chunk_text, embedding):

# Normalize the embedding

embedding_array = np.array(embedding)

norm = np.linalg.norm(embedding_array)

if norm == 0:

normalized_embedding = embedding_array.tolist()

else:

normalized_embedding = (embedding_array / norm).tolist()

document = {

'doc_id': doc_id,

'text': chunk_text,

'embedding': normalized_embedding,

'embedding_norm': norm

}

self.collection.insert_one(document)

def search_similar_chunks(self, query_embedding, limit=5):

# Normalize query embedding

query_array = np.array(query_embedding)

query_norm = np.linalg.norm(query_array)

if query_norm == 0:

normalized_query = query_array.tolist()

else:

normalized_query = (query_array / query_norm).tolist()

# Create the aggregation pipeline

pipeline = [

{

"$addFields": {

"dot_product": {

"$reduce": {

"input": { "$zip": { "inputs": [ "$embedding", normalized_query ] } },

"initialValue": 0,

"in": {

"$add": [

"$$value",

{ "$multiply": [ { "$arrayElemAt": [ "$$this", 0 ] }, { "$arrayElemAt": [ "$$this", 1 ] } ] }

]

}

}

}

}

},

{ "$sort": { "dot_product": -1 } },

{ "$limit": limit },

{ "$project": { "text": 1, "dot_product": 1, "_id": 0 } }

]

results = list(self.collection.aggregate(pipeline))

return results

Then, the processing script (process_documents.py):

import boto3

from config import S3_BUCKET

import os

from document_processor import DocumentProcessor

from embeddings import EmbeddingGenerator

from vector_db import VectorDB

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

processor = DocumentProcessor()

embedder = EmbeddingGenerator()

vdb = VectorDB()

def download_from_s3(s3_key, local_path):

s3.download_file(S3_BUCKET, s3_key, local_path)

def process_s3_documents():

# List all objects in S3 bucket

response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=S3_BUCKET)

for obj in response.get('Contents', []):

s3_key = obj['Key']

file_name = os.path.basename(s3_key)

file_type = file_name.split('.')[-1].lower()

local_path = f"/tmp/{file_name}"

# Download file

download_from_s3(s3_key, local_path)

# Process file

try:

chunks = processor.process_file(local_path, file_type)

except NotImplementedError as e:

print(f"Skipping {file_name}: {e}")

continue

# Generate embeddings and store

doc_id = s3_key

for chunk in chunks:

embedding = embedder.generate_embedding(chunk)

vdb.store_chunk(doc_id, chunk, embedding)

print(f"Processed {file_name} into {len(chunks)} chunks")

if __name__ == "__main__":

process_s3_documents()

Then, the chatbot script (chatbot.py):

from embeddings import EmbeddingGenerator

from vector_db import VectorDB

import boto3

import json

from config import AWS_REGION

class ChatBot:

def __init__(self):

self.embedder = EmbeddingGenerator()

self.vdb = VectorDB()

self.bedrock = boto3.client(service_name='bedrock-runtime', region_name=AWS_REGION)

def generate_response(self, question):

# Step 1: Embed the question

query_embedding = self.embedder.generate_embedding(question)

# Step 2: Search similar chunks

chunks = self.vdb.search_similar_chunks(query_embedding, limit=3)

context = "\n\n".join([chunk['text'] for chunk in chunks])

# Step 3: Generate response with Claude

prompt = f"""Human: You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question based on the context below.

Context:

{context}

Question: {question}

Assistant:"""

body = json.dumps({

"prompt": prompt,

"max_tokens_to_sample": 1000,

"temperature": 0.5,

"top_p": 0.9,

})

response = self.bedrock.invoke_model(

body=body,

modelId='anthropic.claude-v2:1',

accept='application/json',

contentType='application/json'

)

response_body = json.loads(response['body'].read())

return response_body['completion']

if __name__ == "__main__":

bot = ChatBot()

question = input("Enter your question: ")

answer = bot.generate_response(question)

print("Answer:", answer)

Additional considerations:

- Error handling in the code.

- Security: Ensure DocumentDB is in a private subnet, proper security groups.

- IAM roles must have permissions for S3, Bedrock, DocumentDB.

- Lambda functions may need to be in a VPC with access to DocumentDB.

- Handling large documents: Timeouts, chunking appropriately.

- Install required packages: boto3, pymongo, pandas, PyPDF2, numpy, langchain.

But the user wants the code not to miss anything, so perhaps include a requirements.txt and setup instructions.

requirements.txt:

boto3>=1.28

pymongo>=4.0

pandas>=1.5

PyPDF2>=3.0

numpy>=1.24

langchain>=0.0.330

Deployment steps:

1. Set up S3 bucket.

2. Set up DocumentDB cluster with appropriate security groups, VPC settings.

3. Install the code on an EC2 instance or Lambda function (with sufficient memory/timeout).

4. Configure IAM roles with permissions to access S3, Bedrock, and DocumentDB.

5. Run the process_documents.py to ingest existing files from S3.

6. Use chatbot.py to query.

Security notes:

- Use SSL for DocumentDB connection.

- Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables, not in code.

- In the code example, the DocumentDB URI is in config.py; in practice, use environment variables or a secure method.

Possible missing parts:

- Handling of the Erwin format. The code includes a placeholder but needs customization.

- Indexes in DocumentDB for performance. Create an index on the embedding field? But with high dimensions, it's not feasible. The aggregation will be slow on large datasets.

- Batch processing of documents.

- Error handling for Bedrock API calls (e.g., retries, rate limiting).

- Logging and monitoring.

Including all these would make the code more robust, but the user requested not to miss anything, so maybe add some error handling.

For example, in the EmbeddingGenerator:

def generate_embedding(self, text):

try:

body = json.dumps({

"inputText": text

})

response = self.bedrock.invoke_model(

body=body,

modelId='amazon.titan-embed-text-v1',

accept='application/json',

contentType='application/json'

)

response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())

embedding = response_body.get('embedding')

if not embedding:

raise ValueError("No embedding found in response")

return embedding

except Exception as e:

print(f"Error generating embedding: {e}")

raise

Similarly, in other parts.

Also, note that the user is in a private AWS environment, so they need to ensure that the endpoints for Bedrock, S3, and DocumentDB are accessible. This might require VPC endpoints or proper routing.

Finally, the code provided is a starting point, but actual deployment requires considering scalability, security, and error handling specific to the user's environment.

(Due to technical issues, the search service is temporarily unavailable.)

Here's an end-to-end solution implementation. Due to space constraints, I'll provide the core components with critical implementation details.

4. Deployment Considerations
Security:

Use IAM roles with least privilege

Enable SSL for DocumentDB connections

Use VPC endpoints for private AWS environment

Encrypt S3 bucket and DocumentDB at rest

Scaling:

Use AWS Batch for large document processing

Implement connection pooling for DocumentDB

Add caching layer for frequent queries

Monitoring:

CloudWatch metrics for Bedrock usage

DocumentDB performance insights

S3 access logging

Error Handling:

Implement retry logic for Bedrock API calls

Add dead-letter queues for failed processing

Comprehensive logging for all components

This implementation provides a complete foundation. You'll need to:

Implement Erwin file parser based on your specific format

Configure VPC settings for private AWS environment

Add error handling and logging based on your requirements

Set up proper IAM roles and security policies

Implement CI/CD pipeline for deployment

The solution can be deployed on EC2, ECS, or Lambda depending on your scale requirements
